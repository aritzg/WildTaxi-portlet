/**
 * The implementation of the message local service.

 * <p>
 * All custom service methods should be put in this class. Whenever methods are added, rerun ServiceBuilder to copy their definitions into the {@link net.sareweb.wildtaxi.service.MessageLocalService} interface.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Never reference this interface directly. Always use {@link net.sareweb.wildtaxi.service.MessageLocalServiceUtil} to access the message local service.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This is a local service. Methods of this service will not have security checks based on the propagated JAAS credentials because this service can only be accessed from within the same VM.
