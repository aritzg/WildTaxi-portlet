 * The implementation of the message remote service.

 * All custom service methods should be put in this class. Whenever methods are added, rerun ServiceBuilder to copy their definitions into the {@link net.sareweb.wildtaxi.service.MessageService} interface.

 *
 * <p>
 * Never reference this interface directly. Always use {@link net.sareweb.wildtaxi.service.MessageServiceUtil} to access the message remote service.

 * This is a remote service. Methods of this service are expected to have security checks based on the propagated JAAS credentials because this service can be accessed remotely.
